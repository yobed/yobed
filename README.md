## "Local LLM w/ RAG implementation" -- [github.com/yobed/local-llm]
* This project was a journey into local LLMs and RAG. I used **LangChain** community and data from my [github.com/yobed/wsb] wallstreebets sentiment data.
* I did a deep dive into understanding how RAG works **(embeddings, vector storage, searches, cosine similarity, etc)**, and how it is implemented, allowing for context within the LLM model.
* Ran using `deepseek-r1:7b` for the LLM, and `nomic-embed-text` for embeddings.

## "r/Wallstreetbets sentiment analysis" -- [github.com/yobed/wsb]
* This project processes r/wallstreetbets data, uses LLMs for sentiment analysis, and shows these findings with stock market trends.
* It's interesting to look at volume and sentiment throughout those years, as well as validating LLMs for reasoning fields -- the LLM will display it's reason for sentiment.
* *WIP (Might go back and use a local llm for this)*
